# SPIN Short Course 1  - Wave Propagation & Computational Seismology
_Online_
_30 March - 1 April, 2022_  

---


## Scientific Program

The main focus of this short course will be on computational seismology. 

We will cover the following topics: 

- Fundamentals of wave propagation: wave equation, moment tensor, source time functions, reciprocity, Greenâ€™s functions
- Finite-difference method, pseudo-spectral methods, linear finite-element method
- Spectral element method, finite volume method, discontinuous Galerkin method
- Community solvers: Specfem, AxiSEM3D, Seissol
- Discussion: bring along your wave modelling problem

In addition to lectures and discussions, there will be practical exercises using Jupyer notebooks and Python. A solid grasp of Python and Obspy is therefore a prerequisite for participation in the short course. 

A preliminary schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKUDYZ9qPLaF7V_br0qdGbrn-JYmIrpjBh1FlNUulX0/edit?usp=sharing).

The lectures will be recorded and posted to the [SPIN Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcsvKNYDSbeGuOVRhHZobIA).
