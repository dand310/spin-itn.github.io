## Excursion Schneefernerhaus Thursday November 25, 2021

We will depart from the venue at Tutzing 9am by bus and drive to the  Tiroler Zugspitzbahn south of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (approx. 1.5hrs) , that will take us to the summit of the Zugspitze (2950m), the tallest mountain in Germany. After exploring the views from the summit we will make our way (via two gondolas) to the [Schneefernerhaus](schneefernerhaus.de) environmental science observatory.

At the Schneefernerhaus we will get a tour of the observatory and then settle in the conference hall with spectacular view for brief SPIN presentations. We will make our way down from approx. 15:00 using the rack railway from the [Sonnalpin restaurant](zugspitze.de). 
Note that some time (e.g. waiting for gondola) may be spent outside and the __temperature may be below -10° centigrade. So please bring appropriate clothing and solid shoes__. Beware of the 3000m altitude.
