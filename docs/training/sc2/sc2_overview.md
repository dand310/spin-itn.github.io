## Scientific Program

The second SPIN short course will focus on __hands-on experience with seismic instrumentation__, including new types of sensors such as DAS and rotational seismometers. The short course will consist of lectures, deployment of different types of sensors in the field. This will be complemented by computer practicals to work with typical data sets for each type of sensor. Note that these computer practicals will rely heavily on Python and Obspy, so __a solid grasp of programming with these tools is a pre-requisite for participation.__

## Practical exercises
During the short course, we will work on the data that is recorded by the different instruments during practical exercise sessions. For this, please bring your laptop, with sufficient free disk space, or an external disk, for storing and processing data.   
Specific information about what to install on your laptop beforehand will follow by email. In any case, you will need a Python setup (at least 3.6), e.g. in an anaconda environment.

More bus transfer times will be added, depending on arrival times of particpants. However, if you can organize your travel to to correspond to one of the 'main' bus transfer times, it facilitates things on our end!
