## Scientific Program

The "Interrogating the Restless Earth" short course will provide all of the mathematical theory and practical application experience that you need to get your particular Earth imaging, monitoring, or more generally interrogation project working in the real world. Taught as a 5 day retreat in an amazing and beautiful location in the Scottish Highlands, by top tier Geophysics professors from around Europe and beyond, this course will be divided between theory in the mornings and more practical exercises in the afternoons. To freshen up, each day there is time for rest, walks, cycling, visiting local attractions, or a range of other activities.

This Short Course is designed for post-graduate students undertaking Masters or Ph. D. level degrees, post-doctoral associates and fellows, and academic, governmental, industrial or other professional staff. Attendees will be expected to have a reasonable background in scientific mathematical methods at undergraduate level, as provided for example by an undergraduate degree in quantitative, physical scientific, engineering, mathematics or informatics.

## Practical exercises

## Schedule 

A preliminary schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcfPWzSwqqhhH1ZFYfdOCANxjzUST5-Ikg274SABGw0/edit#).   
Note that the short course program in Pitlochry starts early morning on 20.03. A coach leaves from Edinburgh to the conference venue on 19.03 in the afternoon. It therefore makes sense to arrive in Edinburgh the morning of the 19.03.

## Accommodation

During the SPIN Short Course, you will stay at the hotel rooms in the conference venue. You do not need to reserve the rooms yourself, this will be part of the registration process.
Accommodation is all full board (the price includes breakfast, lunch and dinner), and both lunch and dinner will be vegetarian for everybody to reduce the climate impact of the event. There is an option to share a twin room or have a room to yourself.
The registration fee for the short course will be approximately £170 (or £345 if you attend both the short course and the workshop). In addition, the cost of rooms for the entire short course is £497.50 for sharing a twin room and £745 for a room to yourself. We will inform you about the exact amount when the final registration opens.

Coach transport (included in the registration fee) will be provided from Edinburgh to Pitlochry and back. The coach will be departing at 15.00 from Edinburgh Waverly (central Edinburgh) on the 19th and will go via the airport to collect anyone from there (it will only wait for a maximum of 20 minutes). The return coach will leave from Pitlochry at 09:00 on the 24th and will drop anyone off at the airport before arriving at Edinburgh Waverly at ~11.00.
