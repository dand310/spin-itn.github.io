## Scientific Program

We will have an exciting scientific program, with lectures by experts in the field, and with ample time for in-person discussions! A preliminary schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBGdRGnIPDmZ-7E8dC5qLr3QOGhANCRbYbsGCj-q2Cg/edit?usp=sharing). 

The main focus of this workshop will be on the monitoring and understanding of the time-dependent behavior of the Earth's crustal materials. It will include contributions on the theoretical background to nonclassical nonlinear elasticity.  In addition to the scientific focus, training in transferable skills will also be offered. 

We will cover four main topics: 

- __The Earthâ€™s elastic wavefield__ (seismic interferometry, wave scattering, ambient seismic noise generation)
- __Nonlinear and time dependent elasticity__ (experimental evidence from laboratory)
- __Field observations of changing elasticity__ (volcanoes, fault zones, mountains, hydrology shaking, stress changes, ...)
- __Modeling non-classical elastic behavior__ (velocity changes, hysteresis, recovery, ...)

Confirmed speakers include: 

- [Parisa Shokouhi](https://sites.psu.edu/ultrasonics/pshokouhi/) (Penn State Ultrasonics Lab, USA)
- [Ian Main](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/imain/) (University of Edinburgh, UK)
- [Odile Abraham](https://pagespro.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/odile-abraham) (Universit&eacute; Gustave Eiffel, France)
- [Ernst Niederleithinger](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/About-us/Organisation/Organisation-Chart/President/Department-8/Division-82/division82.html) (Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), Germany)
- [Harold Benjamin](https://harold-berjamin.github.io) (NUI Galway, Ireland)
- [Roel Snieder](https://inside.mines.edu/~rsnieder/) (Colorado School of Mines, USA)
- [Ludovic Margerin](https://omp.academia.edu/LudovicMargerin) (University of Toulouse, France)
- [Eleonore Stutzmann](https://www.ipgp.fr/fr/stutzmann-eleonore) (IPGP, France)
- [Celine Hadziioannou](https://celine.hadzii.com/) (University of Hamburg, Germany)
- [Christoph Sens-Schoenfelder](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/christoph-sens-schoenfelder/sec24/) (GFZ, Germany)

There will be the opportunity for participants to present their work, either in short talks or as a poster. During (pre-)registration, you will be able to provide a title or description of the research you would like to present.

__You planned to attend EGU?__   
We are aware that EGU has shifted their "new" dates to overlap with the SPIN  workshop. In order to accommodate participants who have submitted an abstract to EGU and wish to give their presentation, we will provide a separate room with good internet connection, where you can retreat to give your EGU presentation in online format.     
We are considering the option of integrating some of the relevant EGU sessions into the workshop program, either leaving space in the program or by "attending" a session together.

## Schedule
May 22nd: arrival (shuttle times below)
May 23rd - May 27: workshop program
May 28th: departure


## Location and Venue

<img src="/assets/images/ws2/ceveo.png" alt="SPIN WS2 venue" width="100%"/>

The workshop will take place near Bordeaux, along the South Atlantic coast of France. More specifically, the venue is located in Carcans, right between the ocean and a lovely lake: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<iframe width='100%' height='400px' src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/hadzii/ckym7gs2n20rx14nvtitl8dn0.html?title=false&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFkemlpIiwiYSI6ImNrdmF0cW92dTNibnQyb2xwM2c2Mzd6czgifQ.oLTcVRE0U4q1GuobdEevIQ&zoomwheel=false#4.62/45.81/1.67" title="SPIN" style="border:none;"></iframe>


The venue is the '[C&eacute;v&eacute;o Village Vacances](https://www.ceveo.com/en/village/holiday-village-of-carcans)', located in the Landes pine forest, on the edge of the lake.   
Transfer to and from Bordeaux [Train station](https://www.sncf.com/en) and Bordeaux Airport ([Merignac, BOD](https://www.bordeaux.aeroport.fr/en)) will be arranged. 
At the moment, we are aiming for at least one bus departure at the following times on May 22nd: 
- 17:30 from Bordeaux St.-Jean Train station
- 18:00 from Bordeaux Merignac (BOD) Airport   

For departure on May 28th, we aim for a bus transfer from the venue which arrives:
- 10:00 at Bordeaux Merignac (BOD) Airport
- 10:30 at Bordeaux St.-Jean Train station. 

More bus transfer times will be added, depending on arrival times of particpants. However, if you can organize your travel to to correspond to one of the 'main' bus transfer times, it facilitates things on our end! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

To limit the carbon footprint of the meeting, we encourage you to travel by train if possible. For reference, some train connections are listed:   
- Trains arrive from Paris/Z&uuml;rich - every hour:17
- from Grenoble - uneven hour:32
- from Hamburg/ Berlin - 17:17, 19:17
{: style="text-align: justify;"}


## Excursion and activities

<img src="/assets/images/ws2/dune_pilat.png" alt="SPIN WS2 excursion: Dune de Pilat" width="100%"/>

There will be a half-day excursion on Tuesday 24.05, to visit and climb the [highest Sand dune in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_of_Pilat). Afterwards, there will be some time on the Atlantic beach. Bring good walking shoes, your swim suit, and don't forget your towel! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We will also keep some time free in the program to allow for bike rides, strolls through the Landes pine forest, visits to the (lake or ocean) beach, .. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

And of course, it would not be a workshop in France without a delicious gala dinner!


## Accommodation
<img src="/assets/images/ws2/location.png" alt="SPIN WS2 location: Bordeaux!" width="100%"/>

{: style="text-align: justify;"}




Please note that the capacity of the venue in Carcans is limited, and we prioritize participation by researchers who are actively involved in the SPIN project. Therefore we ask you to submit a short statement of your motivation for participation in the workshop as well as your research interests. We will let you know by April 5th whether your registration has been accepted. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Covid regulations

You can find up to date information about the French Covid regulations [here](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coming-to-france-your-covid-19-questions-answered/article/coming-to-france-your-covid-19-questions-answered?var_mode=calcul). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We require that __participants have to be either fully vaccinated or recovered with appropriate internationally valid documentation__.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Note that we will __require all participants to perform a lateral flow test__ before arrival, and we will provide further lateral flow tests to perform during the workshop. 

Please be prepared to bring sufficient __FFP2/KN95-grade masks__ to wear when entering and leaving the venue, the restaurant, etc. and potentially even during the workshop. Details will be provided prior to the workshop depending on the course of the pandemic. You will also need to wear masks in most public spaces in France (public transport, shops, etc).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We are committed to organizing this meeting in-person, but of course we are subject to the evolution of the Covid pandemic. You are probably aware that there is always a risk of cancellation, but we are very hopeful that the situation in May 2022 will be such that the workshop can take place.
