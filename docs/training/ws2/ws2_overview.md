## Scientific Program

We will have an exciting scientific program, with lectures by experts in the field, and with ample time for in-person discussions! 

The main focus of this workshop will be on the monitoring and understanding of the time-dependent behavior of the Earth's crustal materials. It will include contributions on the theoretical background to nonclassical nonlinear elasticity.  In addition to the scientific focus, training in transferable skills will also be offered. 

We will cover four main topics: 

- __The Earthâ€™s elastic wavefield__ (seismic interferometry, wave scattering, ambient seismic noise generation)
- __Nonlinear and time dependent elasticity__ (experimental evidence from laboratory)
- __Field observations of changing elasticity__ (volcanoes, fault zones, mountains, hydrology shaking, stress changes, ...)
- __Modeling non-classical elastic behavior__ (velocity changes, hysteresis, recovery, ...)

Confirmed speakers include: 

- [Parisa Shokouhi](https://sites.psu.edu/ultrasonics/pshokouhi/) (Penn State Ultrasonics Lab, USA)
- [Ian Main](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/imain/) (University of Edinburgh, UK)
- [Ernst Niederleithinger](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/About-us/Organisation/Organisation-Chart/President/Department-8/Division-82/division82.html) (Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), Germany)
- [Bruno Lombard](http://www.lma.cnrs-mrs.fr/spip/spip.php?auteur30&lang=en) (Laboratoire de Mechanique et d'Acoustique, Marseille, France)
- [Roel Snieder](https://inside.mines.edu/~rsnieder/) (Colorado School of Mines, USA)
- [Ludovic Margerin](https://omp.academia.edu/LudovicMargerin) (University of Toulouse, France)
- [Eleonore Stutzmann](https://www.ipgp.fr/fr/stutzmann-eleonore) (IPGP, France)
- [Celine Hadziioannou](https://celine.hadzii.com/) (University of Hamburg, Germany)
- [Christoph Sens-Schoenfelder](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/christoph-sens-schoenfelder/sec24/) (GFZ, Germany)

There will be the opportunity for participants to present their work, either in short talks or as a poster. During (pre-)registration, you will be able to provide a title or description of the research you would like to present.

__You planned to attend EGU?__   
We are aware that EGU has shifted their "new" dates to overlap with the SPIN  workshop. In order to accommodate participants who have submitted an abstract to EGU and wish to give their presentation, we will provide a separate room with good internet connection, where you can retreat to give your EGU presentation in online format.     
We are considering the option of integrating some of the relevant EGU sessions into the workshop program, either leaving space in the program or by "attending" a session together.

## Location and Venue

The workshop will take place near Bordeaux, along the South Atlantic coast of France. More specifically, the venue is located in Carcans, right between the ocean and a lovely lake:

The venue is the '[C&eacute;v&eacute;o Village Vacances](https://www.ceveo.com/en/village/holiday-village-of-carcans)', located in the Landes pine forest, on the edge of the lake.   
Transfer to and from Bordeaux [Train station](https://www.sncf.com/en) and Bordeaux Airport ([Merignac, BOD](https://www.bordeaux.aeroport.fr/en)) will be arranged.

## Excursion and activities

<img src="/assets/images/ws2/vignes.png" alt="SPIN WS2 location: Bordeaux!" width="100%"/>

There will be a half-day excursion, we are still evaluation our options. There are many possibilities in the region: surfing at the beach, climbing the [highest Sand dune in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_of_Pilat), visiting a famous Bordeaux Wine Ch&acirc;teau (including wine tasting), etc etc. Don't worry, whatever we settle on, it will be worth it!   
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We will also keep some time free in the program to allow for bike rides, strolls through the Landes pine forest, visits to the (lake or ocean) beach, ..

And of course, it would not be a workshop in France without a delicious gala dinner!


## Accommodation

During the SPIN workshop, you will stay at the [Ceveo Village de Vacances Carcans](https://www.ceveo.com/en/village/holiday-village-of-carcans). The prices for the freshly renovated rooms are as follows: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

- Single room: 459 &euro; per person for the whole stay.   
- Shared double room: 394 &euro; per person for the whole stay.

## Registration

The registration fee will be determined when pre-registration is complete, but it will be around 150 &euro;, likely less, and in no case more than 200 &euro;, per participant for the whole meeting. The registration fees can be payed via credit card, via a secure online payment system. After registration, you will receive an email with payment information.

__Would you like to attend the workshop?__   
Pre-registration information will be distributed by email to the SPIN-info mailing around mid-february. If you are interested, please subscribe to the mailing list [here](https://mailman.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/mailman/listinfo/spin-info).

## Covid regulations

You can find up to date information about the French Covid regulations [here](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coming-to-france-your-covid-19-questions-answered/article/coming-to-france-your-covid-19-questions-answered?var_mode=calcul). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We require that __participants have to be either fully vaccinated or recovered with appropriate internationally valid documentation__.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Please be prepared to bring sufficient __FFP2/KN95-grade masks__ to wear when entering and leaving the venue, the restaurant, etc. and potentially even during the workshop. Details will be provided prior to the workshop depending on the course of the pandemic. You will also need to wear masks in most public spaces in France (public transport, shops, etc).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We are committed to organizing this meeting in-person, but of course we are subject to the evolution of the Covid pandemic. You are probably aware that there is always a risk of cancellation, but we are very hopeful that the situation in May 2022 will be such that the workshop can take place.
