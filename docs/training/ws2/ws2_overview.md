## Scientific Program

We will have an exciting scientific program, with lectures by experts in the field, and with ample time for discussion! 

The main focus of this workshop will be on the monitoring and understanding of the time-dependent behavior of the Earth's crustal materials. It will include contributions on the theoretical background to nonclassical nonlinear elasticity.  In addition to the scientific focus, training in transferable skills will also be offered. 

We will cover four main topics: 

- __The Earthâ€™s elastic wavefield__ (seismic interferometry, wave scattering, ambient seismic noise generation)
- __Nonlinear and time dependent elasticity__ (experimental evidence from laboratory)
- __Field observations of changing elasticity__ (volcanoes, fault zones, mountains, hydrology shaking, stress changes, ...)
- __Modeling non-classical elastic behavior__ (velocity changes, hysteresis, recovery, ...)

Confirmed lecturers include: 

- [Parisa Shokouhi](https://sites.psu.edu/ultrasonics/pshokouhi/) (Penn State Ultrasonics Lab, USA)
- [Ian Main](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/imain/) (University of Edinburgh, UK)

__Planned to attend EGU?__   
We are aware that EGU has shifted their "new" dates to overlap with the SPIN  workshop. In order to accommodate for participants who have submitted an abstract to EGU and wish to give their presentation, we will provide a separate room with good internet connection, where you can retreat to give your EGU presentation in online format.     
We are considering the option of integrating some of the relevant EGU sessions into the workshop program, either leaving space in the program or by "attending" a session together.

## Excursion and activities

There will be a half-day excursion, we are still evaluation our options. There are many possibilities in the region: surfing at the beach, climbing the [highest Sand dune in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_of_Pilat), visiting a famous Bordeaux Wine Ch&acirc;teau (including wine tasting), etc etc. Don't worry, whatever we settle on, it will be worth it!   
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We will also keep some time free in the program to allow for bike rides, strolls through the Landes pine forest, visits to the (lake or ocean) beach, ..
