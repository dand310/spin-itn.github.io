## Scientific Program

We will have an exciting scientific program, with lectures by experts in the field, and with ample time for in-person discussions! A preliminary schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBGdRGnIPDmZ-7E8dC5qLr3QOGhANCRbYbsGCj-q2Cg/edit?usp=sharing). 

The main focus of this workshop will be on the monitoring and understanding of the time-dependent behavior of the Earth's crustal materials. It will include contributions on the theoretical background to nonclassical nonlinear elasticity.  In addition to the scientific focus, training in transferable skills will also be offered. 

Four main topics were covered: 

- __The Earth’s elastic wavefield__ (seismic interferometry, wave scattering, ambient seismic noise generation)
- __Nonlinear and time dependent elasticity__ (experimental evidence from laboratory)
- __Field observations of changing elasticity__ (volcanoes, fault zones, mountains, hydrology shaking, stress changes, ...)
- __Modeling non-classical elastic behavior__ (velocity changes, hysteresis, recovery, ...)

The presentations by the lecturers during the workshop were uploaded to our Youtube channel (@spin-itn).

__You planned to attend EGU?__   
We are aware that EGU has shifted their "new" dates to overlap with the SPIN  workshop. In order to accommodate participants who have submitted an abstract to EGU and wish to give their presentation, we will provide a separate room with good internet connection, where you can retreat to give your EGU presentation in online format.     
We are considering the option of integrating some of the relevant EGU sessions into the workshop program, either leaving space in the program or by "attending" a session together.

## Location and Venue

<img src="/assets/images/ws2/ceveo.png" alt="SPIN WS2 venue" width="100%"/>

The workshop will take place near Bordeaux, along the South Atlantic coast of France. More specifically, the venue is located in Carcans, right between the ocean and a lovely lake: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<iframe width='100%' height='400px' src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/hadzii/ckym7gs2n20rx14nvtitl8dn0.html?title=false&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFkemlpIiwiYSI6ImNrdmF0cW92dTNibnQyb2xwM2c2Mzd6czgifQ.oLTcVRE0U4q1GuobdEevIQ&zoomwheel=false#4.62/45.81/1.67" title="SPIN" style="border:none;"></iframe>


The venue is the '[C&eacute;v&eacute;o Village Vacances](https://www.ceveo.com/en/village/holiday-village-of-carcans)', located in the Landes pine forest, on the edge of the lake.   
Transfer to and from Bordeaux [Train station](https://www.sncf.com/en) and Bordeaux Airport ([Merignac, BOD](https://www.bordeaux.aeroport.fr/en)) will be arranged. 
At the moment, we are aiming for at least one bus departure at the following times on May 22nd: 
- 17:30 from Bordeaux St.-Jean Train station
- 18:00 from Bordeaux Merignac (BOD) Airport   

For departure on May 28th, we aim for a bus transfer from the venue which arrives:
- 10:00 at Bordeaux Merignac (BOD) Airport
- 10:30 at Bordeaux St.-Jean Train station. 

More bus transfer times will be added, depending on arrival times of particpants. However, if you can organize your travel to to correspond to one of the 'main' bus transfer times, it facilitates things on our end! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

To limit the carbon footprint of the meeting, we encourage you to travel by train if possible. For reference, some train connections are listed:   
- Trains arrive from Paris/Z&uuml;rich - every hour:17
- from Grenoble - uneven hour:32
- from Hamburg/ Berlin - 17:17, 19:17
{: style="text-align: justify;"}


## Excursion and activities

<img src="/assets/images/ws2/dune_pilat.png" alt="SPIN WS2 excursion: Dune de Pilat" width="100%"/>

There will be a half-day excursion on Tuesday 24.05, to visit and climb the [highest Sand dune in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_of_Pilat). Afterwards, there will be some time on the Atlantic beach. Bring good walking shoes, your swim suit, and don't forget your towel! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We will also keep some time free in the program to allow for bike rides, strolls through the Landes pine forest, visits to the (lake or ocean) beach, .. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There will be some musical activities during the workshop as well, so if you play an instrument that is halfway portable, please bring it along! 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

And of course, it would not be a workshop in France without a delicious gala dinner!
