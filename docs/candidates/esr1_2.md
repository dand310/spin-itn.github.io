__Introduction__

My name is Sebastian and I am a PhD-student at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Zurich in the Seismology and Wave Physics Group. My research interests encompass seismic simulations, theoretical aspects of inverse theory as well as newly emerging sensing technologies such as distributed acoustic sensing. Geophysics in general has always been particularly appealing to me because we somehow manage to describe the great outdoors with codes and numbers – except when we cannot. In my free, you can probably find me either hiking or skiing in the mountains.
