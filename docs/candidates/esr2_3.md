__Introduction__

I am an Electrical, Telecommunication and Computer Engineer from Thessaloniki, Greece. I graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with an integrated master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I also hold a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the University of Macedonia. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on body-centric terahertz nano-communications within the Wireless Communications and Information Processing Group of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In the last year of my undergraduate studies, I did an internship at NET2GRID B.V., where I worked on multi-phase load detection and clustering and investigated the use of reactive power measurements in non-intrusive load monitoring. After graduating I worked as a research assistant at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, where I was involved in EU Horizon 2020 research projects related to machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, and as a machine learning engineer at Pragma-IoT, where I worked on computer vision algorithms for mobile devices in collaboration with Samsung Research UK. In October 2022 I joined the SPIN ITN as an early-stage researcher at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh and a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. My PhD project concerns the development of next-generation physics-based earthquake forecasts. I am excited to embark on this PhD project as it is a project at the intersection of machine learning, which is my area of expertise, and geosciences, which is a field that I am keep to delve into.
