__Introduction__

My name is Eleanor and I am originally from Bedfordshire, England. I am currently doing my PhD at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Ireland. I have always enjoyed learning about volcanoes and completed a Masters by Research in Volcanology at Durham University before deciding to also incorporate some seismology into my studies. I enjoy research because of the places it can take me as well as the new skills I learn every day! Outside of research I also enjoy reading, creative writing and hiking.
