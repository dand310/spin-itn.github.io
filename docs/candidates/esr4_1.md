__Introduction__

My name is Eleanor and I am originally from Bedfordshire, England. I am currently doing my PhD at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Ireland. I have always enjoyed learning about volcanoes and completed a Masters by Research in Volcanology at Durham University before deciding to also incorporate some seismology into my studies. I enjoy research because of the places it can take me as well as the new skills I learn every day! Outside of research I also enjoy reading, creative writing and hiking.

Description: An STA/LTA detection algorithm to detect local triggering events on Sierra Negra. This ‘dynamic triggering’ occurred following the Mw10/01/2018 earthquake north of Honduras.

Description: The dynamic strain calculated for a Mw7.6 Mexican earthquake that occurred on 19/09/22. The dynamic strain calculated using the vector norm of all three components can be used as a threshold to work out when dynamic triggering will occur.
