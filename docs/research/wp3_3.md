## General information

This PhD position is one of the 15 Early Stage Researcher (ESR) positions within the SPIN project.  SPIN is an Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

SPIN will focus on training 15 PhD candidates in emerging measurement technologies in seismology. We will research the design of monitoring systems for precursory changes in material properties, all while optimizing observation strategies. The unique interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral network will enable PhDs to gain international expertise at excellent research institutions, with a meaningful exposure of each PhD to other disciplines and sectors, thus going far beyond the education at a single PhD programme.

__Project description__

With the advent of large and heterogeneous datasets (e.g. DAS, dense arrays of nodes) it is possible to discover new, ‘hidden’ signals, besides earthquakes, which can directly inform us about the spatiotemporal evolution of elastic properties on a fault (e.g. processes occurring during earthquake nucleation, volcanic eruptions etc). In this project we will develop and apply coherence-based methods for new instruments and heterogeneous datasets, exploiting the different sensitivities of different sensors. This combination of technique and new data will be used to detect tiny and exotic signals (e.g. tremor-like, emergent) often escaping routine analysis. The coherence features will be used to obtain a global view of the wavefield, for a rapid identification of anomalous signals, and classification of large seismic datasets through clustering algorithms. During this project, different datasets will be explored, including DAS and dense array of nodes installed in volcanic areas, close to major seismogenic faults, and/or in glaciers. The project will require mobility in between the main host institute (ISTerre, Grenoble) and ETH, Zurich.
