**Seismology is the science of studying measured mechanical vibrations of the Earth**. These vibrations are
caused by seismic waves propagating through the planet’s interior. Just as we use ultrasound for medical imaging,
seismic waves provide a window through which to view our planet’s interior. They can be used to warn of
upcoming volcanic eruptions and tsunami by **detecting earthquakes, to determine subsurface structure**, and to
investigate the nature of our planet. And just as new developments in ultrasound technology allow us to monitor
processes in the human body[^1] (motion, flow, change of stiffness), seismological methods are now commonly used
to **continuously monitor earth processes and their associated hazards** such as earthquakes, permafrost melting,
river flow, landslides, glacier motion and avalanches.

**Currently, for the first time in decades, revolutionary changes in how we measure seismic waves are
emerging**, using novel technologies such as fibre-optic (communication) cables, rotational motion sensors, and
extremely dense networks. These new sensing technologies **record the wavefield with high spatial resolution**,
and they are reaching a level of maturity where we can incorporate them into seismological applications.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Furthermore, **over the last decade**, the emergence of methods that use ambient seismic waves or ‘noise’ led to
**numerous observations of dynamic variations in seismic wave speed**[^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6]; **these cannot be explained by
classical seismology** which would predict constant seismic velocities. To-date, our interpretations of velocity
variations associated with earthquakes, the onset of volcanic eruptions and landslides[^7] [^8] [^9] remain phenomenological.
This is related to the fact that seismology is largely based on a simplistic model of material behaviour adopted a
century ago: namely, the linear relation between applied stress and resulting deformation known as Hooke’s law.
However, **on scales relevant to natural hazards**, the mechanical behaviour of rocks, sediments and other microinhomogeneous materials such as concrete can be very complex. This can lead to **far more complex wave propagation phenomena**[^10] than that usually accounted for in global or regional wave propagation theory.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

This is where the **unprecedented dense spatial sampling** of the wavefield, or **direct access to local deformations
or wavefield gradients**[^11] provided by the new sensing technology will play an important role. It allows us to relax
our assumptions on wavefield properties, and instead exploit the **information contained in the wavefield in its
full complexity**. The wavefield gradients in particular are more sensitive to local, small-scale heterogeneities and
changes in the subsurface[^12].
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

However, these new observations that are inexplicable by current seismological theory have two implications: **(1)**
We must adapt our physical theoretical framework to prepare for the **next generation of imaging and
interrogation techniques** that use the **unprecedented detail of new wave observations** provided by these novel
sensing technologies; **(2)** Seismology can provide **much more information about the subsurface** than currently
exploited. This disruptive convergence of ground motion sensing technology and observational evidence for
dynamic variations in the mechanical behaviour of Earth’s materials, reveals the potential for **revolutionary
progress in our ability to image, monitor and understand dynamic earth processes associated with natural
hazards.**
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Since the new sensor types are not yet widespread, there are still few young scientists worldwide with the
knowledge necessary to apply them. We will **train the next generation of experts** who have the skills and
background to **incorporate emerging observation technology to address challenging science problems** related
to monitoring natural hazards. They will have a **deep understanding of the new sensor technology**, including the
strengths and limitations of each type. They will learn how to **design experiments** so that different sensors are
used optimally, depending on the process that should be studied and the **physical phenomena** that likely play a
role. This will all be based on a solid comprehension of **wave propagation physics** in complex media.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}


**Our research strategy** covers the entire workflow from instrument via
physics to monitoring applications: [**WP2**](/wp2/) develops and tests
new physical models of transient subsurface changes,
allowing conception of entirely new observation and
sensing strategies to be developed in [**WP1**](/wp1/). At the interface
between the scientific work packages is [**WP3**](/wp3/), providing
the methodological framework for optimal experiments for
specific research questions and applications. All these WPs
provide input to the hazard and monitoring applications to
be addressed in [**WP4**](/wp4/). The scientific WPs complement each
other, and are all embedded into the training WP.
Research output of SPIN flows into impact and
dissemination activities, and SPIN is supported overall by the
management WP.
